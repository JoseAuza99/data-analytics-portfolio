# 📉 Non-Linear and Logistic Regression Models in Python  

This project explores **Non-Linear Regression Models** and **Logistic Regression** techniques using Python.  
It covers advanced regression concepts, model estimation, and classification applications.

## 🎯 Objectives  

✅ Understand and apply **non-linear and logistic regression techniques**.  
✅ Estimate and evaluate models beyond simple linear relationships.  
✅ Use statistical tools to analyze non-linear patterns and classification accuracy.  

## 🛠 Tools Used  

💻 **Programming:** Python (pandas, numpy, statsmodels, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn)  
📊 **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  
📓 **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  

## 📂 Project Structure  

📌 **Regression Notebooks:**  
- 📖 [Non-Linear & Logistic Regression](https://github.com/JoseAuza99/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/main/NonLinear_Regression/Lab%203.3%20Estimaci%C3%B3n%20modelos%20de%20regresi%C3%B3n%20no%20lineal%20y%20log%C3%ADstica%20en%20Python.ipynb) → Estimation of non-linear and logistic regression models.  

## 📌 Data Handling  
📂 **Datasets Used:**  
- 🗂 **Boston Housing Dataset (`boston.csv`)** → Used for regression analysis.  
- 🌍 **AirQuality Dataset (`statsmodels.datasets`)** → Used for regression modeling and visualization.  
- 🏥 **Breast Cancer Dataset (`sklearn.datasets`)** → Used for classification problems with logistic regression.  
- 🚢 **Titanic Dataset (`sns.load_dataset`)** → Used for logistic regression and survival analysis.  

All datasets are loaded within the notebooks for exploratory analysis, regression modeling, and classification tasks.
