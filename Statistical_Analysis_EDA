# 📊 Exploratory Statistical Analysis in Python

This lab explores key statistical techniques for exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python.  
It covers central tendency and dispersion measures, kurtosis analysis, normality checks,  
and data visualization to extract key insights.

## 🔍 **Objectives**

- Apply exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques.  
- Use descriptive statistics to understand data.  
- Generate effective visualizations using Python.  

## 🛠 **Tools Used**

- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📝 **Project Structure**

- `Lab_Statistical_Analysis.ipynb` → Notebook containing the exploratory data analysis.  
- The dataset is generated within the notebook.  

## 📊 **Key Analyses Conducted**

- Data distribution analysis.  
- Calculation of statistical measures (mean, median, mode, standard deviation).  
- Normality assessment using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plots.  
- Data visualization using histograms, pie charts, line plots, and bar plots.  

## 🔍 **Key Findings**

- Identified patterns in the distribution of key variables.  
- Analyzed data distribution using pie charts.  
- Generated insights based on graphs and statistics.
