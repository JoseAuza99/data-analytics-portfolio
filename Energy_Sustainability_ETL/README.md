# 🌱 Energy Sustainability ETL - Big Data Processing in PySpark  

This project focuses on processing large-scale **energy sustainability datasets** using **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) techniques** in **PySpark**.  
The goal is to analyze and structure data related to **companies, renewable energy projects, and environmental regulations**.  

## 🎯 Objectives  

✅ Perform an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand dataset structure and quality.  
✅ Apply **data transformation techniques** to generate efficiency metrics and economic benefit calculations.  
✅ Implement **ETL processes** to clean, integrate, and analyze large-scale sustainability data.

## 📊 Key Analyses Conducted  
🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
🔹 Energy efficiency calculations using renewable energy contributions  
🔹 Economic benefit estimations based on subsidies, taxes, and savings  
🔹 ETL pipeline implementation in PySpark  

---

## 🔍 Key Findings  
🔹 Standardization of energy data was necessary due to inconsistencies in company names and country labels.  
🔹 Efficiency metrics helped classify companies as "sustainable" based on their renewable energy usage.  
🔹 Financial models were built to assess the economic impact of energy projects.
